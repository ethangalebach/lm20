# Filings for Activity of Labor Relations Consultants (Anti-union consultants)

Labor relation consultants hired by employers to oppose a union drive are required to file reports about their activities to the Department of Labor. These forms are called LM20 and LM21. 

This repository gathers these reports from the [Office of Labor-Management Standards's Online Public Disclosure Room](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/public-disclosure-room) and organized it into a database.
